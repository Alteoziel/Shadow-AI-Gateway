**Last updated:** 2026-07-19  
**Current phase:** Phase 1 — Crawl (Asynchronous Proxy Setup)  
**Checkpoint status:** `blocked_on_human` — Checkpoint #1 (`app/proxy/interceptor.py`)

---

## 1. Executive Context

We are building an **enterprise security proxy** that sits between corporate users and public LLMs (OpenAI / Anthropic) to prevent data leaks **pre-flight**. The gateway:

1. Intercepts outbound LLM traffic before it leaves the private network
2. Sanitizes prompts (Phase 2+) and enforces access rules
3. Tracks token consumption, errors, and risk metrics (Phase 3+)
4. Logs audit trails for compliance and operational risk management
5. Runs as a long-lived async service (Docker on Fly.io / Render / later AWS ECS) — **not** on Vercel serverless (streaming timeout risk)

### Human-in-the-Loop & Resume Constraint

This is a 12-month portfolio project. AI agents do ~90% of boilerplate and heavy lifting. The human Engineering Manager **must hands-on engineer the core logic of each pillar at least once or twice**, so every architectural choice and operational mechanism is resume-defensible.

By project end, the human must truthfully claim:

1. **Developed an asynchronous enterprise API proxy** handling outbound LLM traffic, reducing data-exposure risks by intercepting prompts pre-flight.
2. **Engineered a localized Python data-scrubbing pipeline** using NLP tokenization to automatically redact PII with sub-100ms latency.
3. **Integrated a PostgreSQL database layer** to securely track token consumption metrics, error tracking, and risk-management audit trails.
4. **Packaged application using Docker** and built infrastructure-as-code (Terraform) deployment pipelines to securely host the gateway within a private cloud network.

## 2. Agent Hierarchy (Chain of Command)

| Role | Model | When to invoke |
|------|-------|----------------|
| **THE BRAIN** | Opus 4.8 | Extremely sparingly. High-level architectural impasses only. Do **not** invoke unless explicitly told. |
| **SENIOR ENGINEER** | Grok 4.5 | Architect, workflow designer, reviewer. Directs building; not the primary bulk code doer. |
| **THE DOER / ACHIEVER** | Composer 2.5 / Auto 2.5 | Bulk file generation, boilerplate, configurations, baseline tests, refactoring. |
| **THE SECURITY CHIEF** | GPT-5.6 Sol | Extreme edge cases only: data scrubbing perfection, pre-flight tokenization, cryptographic verification, exhaustive security test coverage. |

**Default cycle:** Grok designs → Composer builds → Grok reviews → Human fills checkpoint → validation scripts run.

## 3. Four-Phase Timeline & Progression Audit

Status vocabulary: `not_started` | `in_progress` | `blocked_on_human` | `complete`

### Phase 1: The Crawl Phase (Months 1–3) — Asynchronous Proxy Setup

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | `in_progress` |
| **Checkpoint status** | `blocked_on_human` |
| **Checkpoint file** | `app/proxy/interceptor.py` |
| **Owner (checkpoint)** | Human |

**What we build:** A FastAPI Python service that accepts a text prompt, forwards it asynchronously to OpenAI or Anthropic, handles streaming responses, and passes the answer back.

**What the human learns:** Web requests, `async`/`await`, API routing, HTTP status codes, environment variables.

**Human checkpoint:** Intercepting the raw outbound client request payload **pre-flight** — implement `intercept_outbound_request(...)` before any upstream provider call.

**Phase 1 technical contract:**

| Item | Spec |
|------|------|
| Runtime | Python 3.12 |
| Framework | FastAPI + Uvicorn |
| HTTP client | `httpx` (async streaming) |
| Config | `pydantic-settings` via env |
| Health | `GET /health` |
| Proxy | `POST /v1/chat/completions` (stream + non-stream) |
| Providers | OpenAI + Anthropic (request or env default) |
| Hosting stubs | `Dockerfile`, `fly.toml`, `render.yaml`, `docker-compose.yml` |
| Out of scope | Scrubbing (Phase 2), DB (Phase 3), Terraform/AWS (Phase 4) |

**Env vars (Phase 1):**

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — OpenAI upstream key
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — Anthropic upstream key
- `DEFAULT_PROVIDER` — `openai` \| `anthropic` (default: `openai`)
- `GATEWAY_HOST` / `GATEWAY_PORT` — bind address (default `0.0.0.0:8000`)
- `LOG_LEVEL` — logging verbosity

---

### Phase 2: The Walk Phase (Months 4–6) — Local AI & Data Manipulation

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | `not_started` |
| **Checkpoint status** | `not_started` |
| **Checkpoint file** | TBD — core string substitution / regex-NLP scrubbing loop |
| **Owner (checkpoint)** | Human |

**What we build:** Pre-forward inspection: string flags (API keys, credit cards) + lightweight local NLP (spaCy or high-performance regex) to redact names/corporate terms as tokens like `[REDACTED_NAME]`. **Latency budget: sub-100ms.**

**What the human learns:** Data scrubbing, string manipulation, tokenization, local text pipelines.

**Human checkpoint:** The core string substitution / regex-NLP scrubbing array loop.

---

### Phase 3: The Run Phase (Months 7–9) — Database & Audit Logs

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | `not_started` |
| **Checkpoint status** | `not_started` |
| **Checkpoint file** | TBD — SQL/ORM insert + analytics schema |
| **Owner (checkpoint)** | Human |

**What we build:** Supabase PostgreSQL. On every employee prompt, asynchronously log timestamp, user ID, token counts, and whether sensitive data leaks were intercepted.

**What the human learns:** SQL schemas, async connection pooling, data relationships, operational risk metrics.

**Human checkpoint:** Writing the raw SQL or ORM model insertion statement and constructing the analytics schema.

---

### Phase 4: The Cloud Phase (Months 10–12) — Infrastructure & DevOps

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | `not_started` |
| **Checkpoint status** | `not_started` |
| **Checkpoint file** | TBD — core `Dockerfile` polish + Terraform `main.tf` resources |
| **Owner (checkpoint)** | Human |

**What we build:** Production `Dockerfile` packaging + Terraform (`main.tf`) modeling the container in an AWS ECS / VPC private cloud network. (Phase 1 already ships staging stubs for Fly/Render.)

**What the human learns:** Containerization, cloud networking, private subnets, infrastructure-as-code.

**Human checkpoint:** Writing the core `Dockerfile` build instructions and defining the basic Terraform resources block.

## 4. Progression Audit Table

| Phase | Name | Checkpoint file | Checkpoint owner | Phase status | Checkpoint status |
|-------|------|-----------------|------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Crawl — Async Proxy | `app/proxy/interceptor.py` | Human | `in_progress` | `blocked_on_human` |
| 2 | Walk — Scrubbing | TBD | Human | `not_started` | `not_started` |
| 3 | Run — Postgres Audit | TBD | Human | `not_started` | `not_started` |
| 4 | Cloud — Docker + Terraform | TBD | Human | `not_started` | `not_started` |

## 5. Operational Protocol (Every Developmental Cycle)

1. **Design & Plan (Grok 4.5)** — Map file modifications. Define contracts, constraints, and the human checkpoint boundary.
2. **Boilerplate (Composer / Auto 2.5)** — Generate structural code, configs, provider adapters, baseline tests. **Never** auto-complete human checkpoint implementations.
3. **Establish Learning Checkpoint** — Before a core feature block is finished, inject a clear:

   ```text
   TODO: Human Hands-On Implementation
   ```

   block in the designated file.
4. **Provide the Cheat Sheet** — Accompany the checkpoint with a concise **3-bullet** conceptual breakdown of *why* the underlying engineering concept works.
5. **Human Implements** — Engineering Manager fills the checkpoint.
6. **Security & Latency Validation** — After human completion, run validation scripts for structural security and (from Phase 2 onward) the sub-100ms processing budget.

---

## 6. Human Checkpoint #1 (Active)

**File:** `app/proxy/interceptor.py`  
**Function:** `intercept_outbound_request(...)`  
**Status:** `blocked_on_human`

### Cheat sheet (why this works)

1. **Pre-flight** means inspect/normalize the outbound payload **before** any bytes hit OpenAI/Anthropic — this is the choke point for later scrubbing and audit.
2. **`async def`** keeps the event loop free to serve other requests while awaiting I/O; the gateway must not block on a single upstream call.
3. Return a **normalized internal request** that provider adapters can stream against; raise `HTTPException(4xx)` on invalid input and never call providers on bad payloads.

### Scope rules for Checkpoint #1

- DO: validate required fields (`model`, `messages`), attach `correlation_id` / `received_at`, return the upstream-ready payload.
- DO NOT: implement scrubbing (Phase 2).
- DO NOT: write DB inserts (Phase 3).
- DO NOT: have agents silently complete this function — leave `NotImplementedError` until the human fills it.

**Call site:** `app/api/v1/chat.py` must always invoke `intercept_outbound_request` before provider streaming.

## 8. Non-Negotiable Guardrails

1. **No Vercel for the streaming proxy** — use Docker on Fly.io, Render, or (Phase 4) AWS ECS for long-lived async streaming.
2. **Sub-100ms scrub budget** applies from Phase 2 onward; measure and enforce with validation scripts.
3. **Never auto-complete human checkpoint blocks** — agents scaffold, document, and test contracts only.
4. **Secrets only via environment variables** — never commit API keys or `.env` files.
5. **The Ledger stays current** — update phase/checkpoint status in this file whenever status changes.
6. **Supabase PostgreSQL** is the production database target (Phase 3); do not invent a parallel primary store.
7. **Bugbot** is integrated for GitHub issue tracking; treat review findings as first-class work items.
8. **Opus 4.8 and GPT-5.6 Sol** are restricted roles — do not invoke without explicit instruction.
